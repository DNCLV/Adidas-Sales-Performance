# Adidas-Sales-Performance
This project entails the creation of a Sales Performance Dashboard specifically focused on Adidas sales within the United States during the timeframe spanning from 2020 to 2021. 
The dashboard will comprise two distinct tabs. The initial tab will provide an overview of sales data pertaining to various regions, products, and retailers. Conversely, the second dashboard will delve deeper into analyzing product popularity and year-over-year sales trends.
